# Colourise-Image-GAN
This is a demonstration of colourising black and white images using a slightly modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The training is done on a specifically curated dataset which is sampled from the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) using [fastai](https://github.com/fastai).

## Workflow
